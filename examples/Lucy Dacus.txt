Freeze frame tidal wave in the passenger side
I'm still a nervous kid after all this time
Can you imagine what it's like to be here with you now?
Forget your current lover, remember me that one July
Who knew one day it'd be so hard to have you by my side?
Now I'm awake at 2 AMWithout a cause to draw you in
Buy-low-sell-high kind of guy
Was I a risk without reward or did I make you proud?
Without a cause to draw you in
I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You'll pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you'rе strong enough, no"
What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you?
Well, I can't do that
Thеre's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh
Didn't mean to empty your perfect body
And fill it with my passing whim
weary of losing
Gullible girl, weak and alluring
I see you holding your breath with your arms outstretched
Waiting for someone to come rip open your chest
You plan to give your body to the flame
You told me to skip school
To go with you to the movies
You knew you were uncool
But you thought you could fool me
They play oldies in the afternoon
For the elderly and me and you
Fred and Ginger, black and white
I watch you watch It's a Wonderful Life
You called me cerebral
I didn't know what you meant
But now I do, would it have killed you
To call me pretty instead?
I'm in a second-story window
And you're yelling at me, "Stella!"And I'm laughing 'cause you think you're Brando
But you'll never come close
All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did
Here and there and gone again
Firefly juice on your skin
You're glowing like an atom bomb
empty cups
in the closet in the hall
You'd say, "We need to talk
Sneak out, meet me on your block"I'd sit by you, silent on the curb
Light another candle on the cake
Cartwheel and a broken wrist
Skin scarred and sun-kissed
We're coming home
From a sermon saying how bent on evil we are
You always wanted to raise a baby by the lake
But if you get married, I'd object
Throw my shoe at the altar and lose your respect
I'd rather lose my dignity
Than lose you to somebody who won't make you happy
I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there, baby, I could use just a little help
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Message just keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
And I ain't getting nowhere
Yeah, I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You know it's unfair that I am here and you are there
I feel short in the exchange
I'm wearing mine out on my sleeve, you're wearing yours where I can't see
But I'll remember your face for years to come
And wonder what you thought about when you got home
Honesty is like a kiss on the lips
Come closer and I'll tell you exactly how it is
Now I'm barely breathing, I'm moving ahead
But if I see you smile, it's gonna knock me dead
I'm stiff in my tracks trying to recover
From whatever drug you used to put me under
I let my mind get turned inside out
Just to see what the kids were laughing about
It wasn't worth understanding something
I could've gone my whole life not knowing
You know what they say about curiosity
That murderer had his chokehold on me
I ran away without turning back
But every now and then, I want what I can't have
You know it's unfair that I am here and you are there
I feel short in the exchange
I show you mine, you walk away
I’m wearing mine out on my sleeve, you're wearing yours where I can't see
But I’ll remember your face for years to come
And wonder what you thought about when you got home
Honesty is like a kiss on the lips
Come closer and I'll tell you exactly how it is
And I'm barely breathing, moving ahead
But if I see you smile, it's gonna knock me dead
I'm stiff in my tracks trying to recover
From whatever drug you usеd to put me under
I don't beliеve in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
It's hard enough for me to not fall in love with every person I see
I let my mind get turned inside out
Just to see what the kids were laughing about
And it wasn’t worth understanding something
I could’ve gone my whole life not knowing
You know what they say about curiosity
That murderer had his chokehold on me
I ran away without turning back
But every now and then, I want what I can't have
We woke up to the thunder
We huddled under covers
We didn't say anything
If you hadn't come over
I would be so much colder
I would be much less confused
And then the water came
And washed it all away
It left me with nothing to say
Could not believe my eyes
I could not recognize
Your face in the rubble
Without you, I am surely the last of our kind
Without you, I am surely the last of my kind
We had a lot to measure
We had more past than pleasure
And time grows deep like weeds
You catch me when I'm falling
Sometimes, I wish you wouldn't
I can't tell if I'm learning
You let the garden die
Without you, I am surely the last of our kind
Without you, I am surely the last of my kind
I may let you see me on my knees
But you'll never see me on all fours
Drooling on the tile
You can't feel it for the first time a second time
You gave me your hands'Cause you didn't know what to do with them
And I showed you the way
Even though I'd never been
I can't undo what I've done, and I wouldn't want to
I wouldn't want to
I wouldn't want to
I drank the dregs of the champagne alone
Warm, flat, coppery coins down my throat
A new year begins, it ushers us in
The knot in my gut is coming with
He'll blame the alcohol
And you'll blame the full moon
She'll blame the fall of man
And I'll blame the part of you
That can't let up on the reins
You've got life in a chokehold
You say that it's all the same
All glittering fool's gold
I can't tell how big my heart is
Let's open the door, see how many fit
You’re worried that you'll go to hell
For all the lives that you can't save
For all the money that you waste
For all the good you throw away
You put out your palm more than the back of your hand
You put out your palm more than the back of your hand
They were wrong when they said "forget the past"Let your flag fly at forever half mast
After dinner, before dark
We'd meet at the same bench in the park
The sunset threw a tantrum
It wasn't ready to go just yet
Mother Earth said, "Time for bed"It resisted and the sky went red
The color filterеd out
Like pulling teeth out of a cloud
The bloody battle еnded
No, the sun can't break the habit of going down
Daniel made a pass
We started flirting after class
Stealing hats and trading jackets
Locking lips and braces, brackets
After dinner, before dark
We'd meet at the same bench in the park
Sweaty palms, averted eyes
Wasn't sure if he and I were going out
Going out
Going out, ooh
Going, going out
The sunset threw a tantrum
It wasn't ready to go just yet
Mother Earth said, "Time for bed"
It resisted and the sky went red
The color filtered out
Like pulling teeth out of a cloud
The bloody battle ended
No, the sun can't break the habit of going down
Going down
Going down, ooh
Going, going down
Slow dancing
At low tide, low tide
Drawn to move
By the moon, by the moon
And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
And I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side
I've got plenty of affection
I'd be glad to show you some time
Slow motion
In double time, double time
You are all
I can't deny
And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
And I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side
I've got plenty of affection
I'd be glad to show you some time
What am I supposed to do
With you in the room?
What am I supposed to say
With your green eyes on my red face?
With your green eyes on my red face
I'll rearrange to let you in
And I'll be your historian
Was I most complete at the beginning or the bow
If past you were to meet future me
Would you be holding me here and now?
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm ever gonna make it home again
It's so far and out of sight
I really need someone to talk to, and nobody else
Knows how to comfort me tonight
Snow is cold, rain is wet
Chills my soul right to the marrow
I won't be happy 'til I see you alone again
'Til I'm home again and feeling right
Snow is cold, rain is wet
Chills my soul right to the marrow
I won't be happy 'til I see you alone again
'Til I'm home again and feeling right
'Til I'm home again and feeling right
I wanna be home again and feeling right
You let me in your world until you had enough
You were always stronger than people suspected
Underestimated and overprotected
You used to be so sweet
Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street
Lately, I've been feeling like the odd man out
I hurt my friends saying things I don't mean out loud
I don't wanna be funny anymore
I got a too-short skirt, maybe I can be the cute one
I don't want the joke to be on me
Yeah, I'll buy the clothes and I'll be the best dressed
Yeah, I'll read the books and I'll be the smartest
I'll play guitar and I'll be the artist
Try not to laugh
I don't wanna be funny anymore
I don't wanna be funny anymore
I don't wanna be funny anymore
Lately, I've been feeling like the odd man out
I hurt my friends saying things I don't mean out loud
I don't wanna be funny anymore
I got a too-short skirt, maybe I can be the cute one
Is there room in the band? I don't need to be the front man
If not, then I'll be the biggest fan
I don't want the joke to be on me
Yeah, I'll buy the clothes and I'll be the best dressed
Yeah, I'll read the books and I'll be thе smartest
I'll play guitar and I'll be the artist
Try not to laugh
I know it'll bе hard
I'm serious
I know it's a first but
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight? Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
You can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, I remember, I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show
But the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing
Or maybe we just stopped trying
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
No, no
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no
I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something you'll never understand
I'll never beat you
I'll never lie
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by
'Cause you
I would die for you
Darlin', if you want me to you
I would die for you
I'm not your lover
I'm not your friend
I am something you will never comprehend, oh
No need to worry
No need to cry
I'm your Messiah and you're the reason why
'Cause you
I would die for you
Darlin', if you want me to you
I would die for you
You're just a sinner I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good whеn you are bad
I'm not a human, I am a dove
I'm your consciencе, I am love
All I really need is to know that you believe
I took her word like a golden ring
I couldn't decide if she was Cole or Justin
I think I called her baby or darling most the time
And taking namеs
I wanted to live by a body of water
With my children and their father
Children and their father
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you," and I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Qu'il me parle de tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose
Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours
Et ça m'fait quelque chose
Il est entré dans mon cœur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause
C'est lui pour moi
Moi pour lui, aujourd'hui
Il me l'a dit
L'a juré, pour la vie
Et dès que je l'aperçois
Alors je sens en moi
Mon cœur qui bat
Hold me close and hold me fast
This magic spell you've cast
I see la vie en rose
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose
Last night I stood at your doorstep
Trying to figure out what went wrong
You slipped something into my palm and you were gone
I could smell the deep green of summer
'Bove me the same night sky was glowin'
In the distance I could see the town where I was born
It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
A long walk home
In town I pass Sal's grocery
Barbershop on old South Street
I looked in their faces
They're all rank strangers to me
Well Veteran's Hall high upon the hill
Stood silent and alone
The diner was shuttered and boarded
With a sign that just said "gone"
It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk home
But I am alive and I made up my mind
To live fearlessly, running wild beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core
Send my regards to the north my friends
I am built for the heat, I regret to admit
My fear of freezing keeps me on my feet
Oh please, don't make fun of me
Of my crooked smile and my crowded teeth
Or my pigeon feet, or my knobby knees
Well, I got more problems than not
But I feel fine and I made up my mind
To live happily, feeling beautiful beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core
Oh please, don't make fun of me
Oh you know I get frightened so easily
When I'm all alone and the floorboards creak
It's those noises in the dark
But I am alive and I made up my mind
To live fearlessly, running wild beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core
Send my regards to the north my friends
I am built for the heat, I regret to admit
My fear of freezing keeps me on my feet
And so far my whole life's one long lucky streak
They say you should take the credit when it comes
But I believe in haunted wood
My mother hates her body
We share the same outline
She swears that she loves mine
I blur at the edges
I'm all soft shapes and lines
Shapeshifting all the time
The stars have a lot to say
About babies born in the month of May
Reading in the phone booth
Sucking on a ginger root
I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin, too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I'll make a desert of my mind
Unfold myself so flat and wide
Have nothing in my line of sight
No cover for my thoughts to hide
Never went to Monaco
But I held your hand in the pocket of my coat
I learned to be in love and learned to be alone
The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit
I mistakenly called them by your name
I was let down, it wasn't the same
I'm doing fine, trying to derail my one-track mind
Regaining my self-worth in record time
But I can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine
Why did I come here? To sit and watch you stare at your feet?What was the plan? Absolve your guilt and shake hands?
I feel no need to forgive, but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark, feeling all hell
You don't deserve what you don't respect
Don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect
You threw your books into the river
Told your mom that you're a non-believer
She said she wasn't surprised
But that doesn't make it okay
You say nobody loves a city
Nobody loves what can't love them back
One-way ticket in your pocket
What happened to the charm of a small town?
If you find what you're looking for
Be sure to send a postcard
You promised you'd never forget
The little ones when you got big
You deal in unspoken debts
No kindness without wanting something back
What do I owe you? What did I forget?Or are we even after all of that?
What good has come from learning to pretend?You said I could've been a better friend
When I was young my elders taught me right
They told me to be kind and polite
I grew up gracious, living by the golden rule
Had not a doubt it was to not be true
Now I have gone across what's aged us since
And I myself have taught hard lessons to good kids
I prayed to god to show me how to love
Then hoped that I'm not the only one
Who wants to know
And I am no scholar
But how would that change
What I know
It's not your fault, it's mine
Let the record show
I walked in on my own
the city that never sleeps
Picking petals to see if you will be mine
Do you lovе me? Do you love me not?Do you lovе me? Do you love me not?Do you love me? Do you love me not?Do you love me? Do you love me not?
When I asked you to coffee
Could you tell I don't drink it?
When I got to the café
Could you tell what I was thinking?
My heart's on my sleeve, it's embarrassing
The pulpy thing, beating
When you asked my age, I lied
I saw relief dawn on your eyes
It's not your fault, it's mine
Let the record show
I walked in on my own
Knee-deep in the city that never sleeps
I lay down in the middle of the street
Lamplight like parallel suns
Crowding out the early morning stars
Concrete holding heat from the daytime
Picking petals to see if you will be mine
Do you love me? Do you love me not?
Do you love me? Do you love me not?
Do you love me? Do you love me not?
Do you love me? Do you love me not?
turning to dust
I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust
For the sparrows
At my window
For they know not what they do
For they know not who you are, Lord
And they know not what to do
Your clothes in the dryer
Your hair on the shower wall
Your toothbrush is too much
Your shoes empty in the hall
Your keys on the counter
Your dirty dish in the sink
Please don't make me see these things
The hunting knife you kept by your bed
The flowers you dried and tied up with twine
Suspended from the ceiling
What else am I supposed to do?Maybe bar the door when you move to leave
I think you mean what you say
When you say you wanna die
I think you mean what you say
When you say you want to stay alive
Seems to me, the way you understand it
Is that you're never gonna make it happen
I get smoke in my eyes every time I try
To look you in the eye and
Do I even know what your face looks like
Or just the cloud of smoke in its place?
I'm trying to tell you something you might've heard before
You've got a mind of gold you keep secret
'Cause I think it's wrong when you sit around
Looking like a toy in the lost and found
I am telling you something you might've heard before
And forgot on the spot
You got yourself a bunch of bad habits
Not hard to see that love is a weakness
Seems to me, the way you understand it
Is that you're never gonna make it happen
I get smoke in my eyes every time I try
To look you in the eye and
Do I even know what your face looks like
Or just the cloud of smoke in its place?
I'm trying to tell you something you mighta heard before
You got a dollar in your pocket
You got a pebble in your sock and
You got a mind of gold you keep secret
I gotta hope that one day you'll use it
I get tongue-tied every time I try
To tell you what I think is right
'Cause I think it's wrong when you sit around
Looking like a toy in the lost and found
I am telling you something you mighta heard before
And forgot on the spot
I am busy doing nothing and you're rudely interrupting
It's a myth and now I see it clearly
You don't have to be sad to make something worth hearing
one more burden off my back
I'm a ghost walking on an empty street
No name anymore, no need to call for me
I'm a long-lost hometown hero
Latent legendary past lives within me
If I had the offer to do it again
Make me invincible, invisible, or brain dead
If the body and the life were two things that we could divide
I'd deliver up my shell to be filled with somebody else
And I asked you what was wrong
I said, "You don't have to see him"But for whatever reason, you can't tell him no
He ordered rum and Coke
I can't drink either anymore
Do you get the checks I send on your birthday?"
I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know how you keep smiling
You hung up the phone
And I asked you what was wrong
Your dad has come to town
He'd like to meet
I said, "You don't have to see him"
But for whatever reason, you can't tell him no
So we meet him at a bar
You were holding my hand hard
He ordered rum and Coke
I can't drink either anymore
He hadn't seen you since the fifth grade
Now you're nineteen and you're 5'8"
He said, "Honey, you sure look great
Do you get the checks I send on your birthday?"
I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know how you keep smiling
Will you remember me as I am now?
And I know you're strong
I know you're a man-made fortress
But we're alone
And I'm so willing to be proven wrong
And I fought time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody
We're going to the five and dime
You're dancing in the aisle 'cause the radio
Is singing you a song you know
Your mama read my palm
Shе wouldn't tell me what it was she saw
But after that, you weren't allowed to spend the night
I'm staring at my hands
Red, ruddy skin, I don't understand
How did they betray me? What did I do?
What can I say to your mom to let you come outside?
You know I'll be seeking if you run and hide
If the door were to open, would you walk through the frame?
Is that a hearse or a limousine?
And I saw a girl that looked like you
And I wanted to tell everyone to run away from her, run away, run away
It couldn't have been you, but she had your eyes
Made for faking smiles and turning tides
Hands full of young men wrapped around her finger
They made you a crown out of peonies
She grew up as the pretty young thing
Let them look up her skirt on the backyard swing, oh no
Too old to play and too young to mess around
I wanna live in a world where I can keep my doors wide open
But who knows what'd get in and what'd get out
One of these nights, I'll sleep with the windows down
But not until that creature's in the pound
Is that a hearse or a limousine?
It's like I've seen it on the TV screen, oh, oh
She had the body of a beauty queen
Put on a pedestal for good hygiene, oh, oh
And I saw a girl who looked like you
And I wanted to tell everyone to run away from her, run away, run away
It couldn't have been you, but she had your eyes
Made for faking smiles and turning tides
Hands full of young men wrapped around her finger
They made you a throne out of magazines
They made you a crown out of peonies, oh, oh
She grew up as thе pretty young thing
Let them look up hеr skirt on the backyard swing, oh no
And Daddy told you to stay indoors
And I can understand how a girl gets bored
Too old to play and too young to mess around
She was a victim of the same disease
That's roaming the streets and bites when it pleases
And makes us wanna live forever or die in infamy
I wanna live in a world where I can keep my doors wide open
But who knows what'd get in and what'd get out
One of these nights, I'll sleep with the windows down
But not until that creature's in the pound
I watched my journals turn to smoke
In the summer of '07, I was sure I'd go to Heaven
But I was hedging my bets at VBS
A preacher in a T-shirt told me I could be a leader
Taught me how to build a fire and to spread The Word
In the evening, everybody went to worship and weep
Hands above our heads, reaching for God
Back in the cabin, snorting nutmeg in your bunk bed
You were waiting for a revelation of your own
Sedentary secrets like peach pits in your gut
Locked away like jam jars in the cellar of your heart
You say that I showed you the light
But all it did, in the end
Was make the dark feel darker than before
Your dad keeps his sleeves down through the summer for a reason
Your mother wears her makeup extra thick for a reason
When I tell you you were born and you are here for a reason
You are not convinced the reason is a good one
Somebody lit the store on fire
Somebody lit the house on fire
Somebody lit the crowd on fire
Have you got nothing to say?
For those of you who told me I should stay indoors
Take care of you and yours, take care of you and yours
But me and mine (Me and mine)Me and mine (Me and mine)
We've got a long way to go before we get home'Cause this ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home
Somebody lit the store on fire
Somebody lit the house on fire
Somebody lit the crowd on fire
